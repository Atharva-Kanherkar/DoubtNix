## Future Plans
- **Resource Sharing:** Allow mentors to share educational resources directly through the platform.
- **Progress Tracking:** Enable students to track their progress over time with goal-setting and milestone tracking.
- **Calendar and Scheduling:** Integrate a calendar system for easy mentoring session scheduling.
- **Task Assignment and Management:** Enable mentors to assign and track student tasks or projects.
- **Feedback and Ratings:** Implement a system for student feedback and mentor ratings.
- **Leetcode Improvement:** Today's leetcode is so unorganised. You go to leetcode, you try to solve problems, there's thousands of problems for one single topic. Its jarring, and the 1000 problems are multi topic too. You just get frustrated and leave leetcode. Wait, doubtnix is here: We want to make it easier for people to solve problems, and also make it more fun.
We aim to simplify the process, offering a curated selection of problems that are structured by topic, ensuring a smoother learning journey.
